# KidsWords
KidsWords is an international collaborative research project on the early language development of children growing up in New Zealand. 
One of the aims of the project is to establish normative data for the New Zealand adaptation of the
*MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory: Words & Sentences*. Another aim is to examine factors thought to be associated with children's early vocabulary and grammatical development.

Over 2,500 parents of toddlers between 16 and 30 months of age, from every region of New Zealand, participated and data were collected at http://kidswords.org. The website is no longer being used for data collection. 

The purpose of this repository is to make our data analyses **reproducible** by others. Consequently, data files and R scripts will be placed in this repository as they become available. 

### Funding
Funding was provided by the [Marsden Fund of the Royal Society of New Zealand](http://royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/marsden/) (UOC 1003) to Thomas Klee, Stephanie F Stokes and Catherine Moran, University of Canterbury, and by the [MacArthur-Bates CDI Advisory Board](https://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/board.html).
