# KidsWords
KidsWords is a collaborative research project on the early language development of children growing up in New Zealand. Parents of toddlers between 16 and 30 months of age participated from every region of New Zealand and data were collected at http://kidswords.org. The website is no longer being used for data collection. 

One of our research aims is **reproducibility** of data analyses; consequently, data files and R scripts will be placed in this repository as they become available. 

### Funding
Funding was provided by the [Marsden Fund of the Royal Society of New Zealand](http://royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/marsden/) (UOC 1003) to Thomas Klee, Stephanie F Stokes and Catherine Moran, University of Canterbury, and by the [MacArthur-Bates CDI Advisory Board](https://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/board.html).
